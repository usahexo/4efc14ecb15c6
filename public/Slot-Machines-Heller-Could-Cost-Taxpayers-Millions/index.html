            <h1 id="Slot-Machines-Heller-Could-Cost-Taxpayers-Millions"><a href="#Slot-Machines-Heller-Could-Cost-Taxpayers-Millions" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machines Heller Could Cost Taxpayers Millions"></a>Slot Machines Heller Could Cost Taxpayers Millions</h1><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p>Do casinos have a legal duty to protect their slot machines from criminals?<br>That question is at the heart of a lawsuit filed by Pennsylvania’s attorney general against the Hollywood Casino near Harrisburg.<br>The casino has been accused of negligence after thieves made off with nearly $1 million in slot machines over a two-year period.</p>
<p>Citing the state’s slots law, the attorney general’s office argues that casinos are required to take measures to protect their machines from theft and damage.<br>The law, which was enacted in 2004, was designed to ensure that taxpayers benefit from the $1.5 billion in annual slot machine revenue generated by casinos in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the casino said that the thefts were not the result of any negligence on the part of the casino and that it has always complied with its security obligations.<br>She also noted that the state Gaming Control Board has never fined Hollywood Casino for any security breaches.</p>
<p>If the casino is found liable, it could be forced to pay millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<h1 id="Assembly-Approves-Slot-Machines-Heller"><a href="#Assembly-Approves-Slot-Machines-Heller" class="headerlink" title="Assembly Approves Slot Machines Heller"></a>Assembly Approves Slot Machines Heller</h1><p>The Nevada Assembly has approved a measure to legalize slot machines in the state, voting 41-1 in favor of the bill.</p>
<p>The vote comes after months of negotiations between the casino industry and law enforcement officials over how to best regulate slots. Under the new law, casinos will be able to install up to 12 slot machines per location, with a maximum bet of $10 per spin. Players must be at least 21 years old to gamble on slots.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Assemblyman Jim Heller, the measure was supported by both the casino industry and law enforcement officials. “This is a good day for the state of Nevada,” Heller said after the vote.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized slots had argued that they would lead to increased crime and gambling addiction rates, but supporters say that the regulations included in Heller’s bill will help mitigate those risks. “This is not an expansion of gambling,” Heller said. “It’s a regulated activity which will generate revenue for the state.”</p>
<p>Under the new law, casinos will be able to install up to 12 slot machines per location, with a maximum bet of $10 per spin</p>
<h1 id="Bill-Would-Allow-Slot-Machines-Heller-in-Racetracks"><a href="#Bill-Would-Allow-Slot-Machines-Heller-in-Racetracks" class="headerlink" title="Bill Would Allow Slot Machines Heller in Racetracks"></a>Bill Would Allow Slot Machines Heller in Racetracks</h1><p>Senator Harry Reid introduced a bill in the Senate on Wednesday that would legalize slot machines in racetracks across the country. The move is an attempt to help struggling racetracks and revive the horse-racing industry.</p>
<p>Slot machines are currently legal in only four states: Nevada, New Jersey, Louisiana, and West Virginia. If the bill is passed, it would allow slot machines in racetracks in all states.</p>
<p>Reid’s office estimates that the bill would create up to 200,000 new jobs and generate $8 billion in new revenue for state governments each year.</p>
<p>The horse-racing industry has been struggling in recent years as gambling options have proliferated. In 2002, there were 440 racetracks operating in the United States. By 2012, that number had dwindled to 101.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalizing slot machines in racetracks argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction and bankrupt families. Supporters say that the option to gamble should be available at tracks just like it is at casinos.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) has come out in support of Reid’s bill. “Legalized gaming is one of America’s most successful economic stories,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the AGA. “This legislation will create jobs and provide much-needed revenue for state governments.”</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machines-Heller-Could-Create-Jobs"><a href="#Slot-Machines-Heller-Could-Create-Jobs" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machines Heller Could Create Jobs"></a>Slot Machines Heller Could Create Jobs</h1><p>Las Vegas, whose economy is based in large part on gambling, could see an uptick in jobs if legislation currently being pushed by Democratic Senator Harry Reid and Republican Representative Dean Heller becomes law. The bill, called the GAME Act, would legalize slot machines on Indian reservations across the country.</p>
<p>According to a study conducted by the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, the legalization of slot machines on Indian reservations would create more than 150,000 jobs across the country. This would be a welcome boost to local economies that are still feeling the effects of the recession.</p>
<p>In Nevada, home of Las Vegas, there are 22 federally recognized tribes with almost 70,000 tribal members. If slot machines were legalized on these reservations, it is estimated that 6,500 new jobs would be created. This would include jobs in casino operations, hospitality, and other service industries.</p>
<p>The GAME Act has been introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, but has not yet been voted on. Supporters of the bill believe that it has a good chance of passing, as both parties have expressed support for it.</p>
<h1 id="New-Bill-would-allow-Slot-Machines-Heller-in-Bars"><a href="#New-Bill-would-allow-Slot-Machines-Heller-in-Bars" class="headerlink" title="New Bill would allow Slot Machines Heller in Bars"></a>New Bill would allow Slot Machines Heller in Bars</h1><p>A new bill has been introduced in the state legislature that would allow slot machines in bars. The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Dan Heller, a Republican from District 25, would amend current law to allow for the machines in establishments that serve alcohol.</p>
<p>“The goal of this bill is to create jobs and generate revenue for the state,” said Heller in a statement. “It will also give people a new option for entertainment.”</p>
<p>According to Heller, the bill would generate an estimated $100 million in revenue for the state each year. He added that the money would be used to fund education and other necessary programs.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say that it will lead to increased crime and addiction rates. They also argue that it will ruin small businesses.</p>
<p>“This bill is bad for Nevada,” said Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a Democrat from District 16. “It will hurt our economy and increase our addiction rates. We should be doing everything we can to help small businesses, not harm them.”</p>
<p> Supporters of the bill argue that it will help create jobs and bring more money into the state. They also say that it will provide adults with more entertainment options.</p>
