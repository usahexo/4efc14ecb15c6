Just what states legalized sports gambling - and when?

The United States Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned most state-sanctioned sports betting on May 14, 2018. The ruling means that each state can now decide whether to allow sports gambling within its borders.

Here is a rundown of which states have moved to legalize sports gambling since the court's ruling.

Delaware: On June 5, 2018, Delaware became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's ruling and launch a full-scale sports betting market. The Delaware Lottery began taking bets on professional, college and international soccer games at three casinos in the state.

New Jersey: New Jersey quickly followed Delaware's lead and also launched a full-scale sports betting market on June 5, 2018. Bettors can place wagers at Atlantic City casinos and the state's former racetracks, which have been rebranded as sportsbooks.

West Virginia: West Virginia also launched its sports betting market on June 5, 2018. There are now five legal sportsbooks in the state, all of which are located at casinos.

Mississippi: Mississippi was one of the next states to begin offering legal sports betting after the Supreme Court's ruling. The Mississippi Gaming Commission issued its first license for a legal sportsbook to William Hill US on July 11, 2018. Sports betting began at properties owned by MGM Resorts International on August 1, 2018. 




#  How to gamble on sports Colossal Cash Zone guide

There’s no question that one of the most exciting aspects of sports is the possibility of gambling on the games. Whether it’s a friendly wager between friends or a serious bet with high stakes, placing a bet on a game can make watching it all the more exciting. If you’re looking to get into gambling on sports, here’s a guide to help you get started.

The first thing you need to do is figure out what kind of gambler you are. Are you someone who likes to take risks and bet big, or are you more comfortable playing it safe and betting smaller amounts? Once you figure out your Risk Level, you can start looking for sportsbooks that fit your needs.

If you’re someone who likes to take risks, then look for sportsbooks that offer high betting limits. These sportsbooks will give you the opportunity to bet large sums of money on games, which can lead to some serious payouts if you win. However, keep in mind that these sportsbooks also come with greater risks, so only gamble what you can afford to lose.

If you’re more comfortable playing it safe, look for sportsbooks that offer lower betting limits. This will allow you to bet smaller amounts without taking on too much risk. And, if you do happen to lose, it won’t be as big a financial hit.

Once you’ve decided on a Risk Level and found a sportsbook that fits your needs, it’s time to start placing bets! Here are some tips for doing so:

1) Know the sport inside and out. This may seem like common sense, but it’s important to have a strong understanding of the sport that you’re gambling on. This will give you a better idea of which teams/players are likely to win and which ones are worth betting on.

2) Do your research. In addition to knowing the sport inside and out, it’s also important to do your research on the teams/players involved in each game. This will help you make informed decisions about which bets to make.

3) Use caution when betting on underdogs. Underdogs often have longer odds than favourites, but that doesn’t mean they always lose. So before placing a bet on an underdog team, make sure that they have a good chance of winning. Otherwise, you may end up losing money instead of winning it.

4) Gamble responsibly. Gambling should always be done in moderation and never as a means of making money back losses incurred from other forms of gambling or via other risky behaviour patterns (i).e., borrowing money etc.). Remember – gambling is meant to be fun, so don’t let it become a source of stress in your life!

#  New Jersey, Delaware join Nevada in legalizing sports gambling Colossal Cash Zone

After a Supreme Court ruling, states can now legalize sports gambling. New Jersey, Delaware and Nevada were the first to do so. The Supreme Court’s decision overturned a federal law that made it illegal for states to authorize sports betting.

Most people expected New Jersey to be the first state to legalize sports gambling but Delaware got there first by passing a bill on June 5th. Governor John Carney said in a statement, “This is a great day for Delaware as we move forward with legalized sports betting. I want to thank the General Assembly for their hard work in getting this legislation passed, and I look forward to seeing the economic benefits it will bring to our state.”

New Jersey quickly followed suit and Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill into law on June 6th. Murphy said in a statement, “I’m proud that today we are making Atlantic City, already a world-class tourist destination, into an even more exciting place to visit and do business. This is good for our economy and it will create jobs.”

Nevada was the third state to legalize sports gambling on June 13th. The governor of Nevada said in a statement, “The wise men of Washington didn’t know what they were doing when they outlawed sports betting in 1992…Today we are proud to reclaim our historic role as the center of gaming and entertainment innovation.”

There are already casinos in all three states that will offer sports gambling. In addition, there are several other states that are considering legalizing sports gambling including Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Michigan.

The Supreme Court’s ruling is seen as a victory for casinos and other businesses that could benefit from expanded sports gambling. It is also seen as a victory for states that believe they should have the right to regulate activities within their borders.
