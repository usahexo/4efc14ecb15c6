It can be tough to maintain composure in high-stress situations, but if you want to be like Michael Crichton, here are a few tips:

1. Stay calm and stay in control.

2. Avoid reacting impulsively.

One of the keys to keeping a poker face is avoiding reacting impulsively. If you can resist the urge to respond right away, you’ll be less likely to say something that you regret later on.

3. Keep your body language under control.

Your body language can give away your feelings too, so it’s important to keep it under control. Sit up straight, don’t fidget, and avoid making any sudden movements.

#  Michael Crichton's 5 tips for keeping a poker face

No matter what you do, there will always be people who can read your poker face. In order to keep your opponents guessing, Michael Crichton has five tips for you.

1. Don't think about anything else when you're playing. This includes not thinking about the hand you just lost or the money you're going to win. Focused intensity is key if you want to keep a poker face.

2. Be aware of your body language. Crossed arms and hunched shoulders can give away your hand. Try to stay loose and open-bodied to avoid suspicion.

3. Keep your emotions in check. It's important not to get too excited or frustrated when playing poker. Emotional displays can give away your hand as easily as physical ones.

4. Use deadpan expressions sparingly. A smile or a laugh might seem innocuous, but it could give away the strength of your hand. Save these expressions for when you've got a winning hand so your opponent will be more likely to fold.

5. Practice, practice, practice! The more comfortable you are with keeping a poker face, the easier it will be to maintain one under pressure
