#  What is the game about?

'The game is about the choices we make, and the people we meet along the way.' This is how Nick Pelling, Co-founder of White Rabbit Gaming, described their upcoming game 'City of the Shroud'.

Choosing between right and wrong is a staple in most video games, but White Rabbit is looking to create a different type of experience by implementing moral grey areas in 'City of the Shroud'. "Every character has their own agenda," Said Pelling. "What they want might not be what you want."

Adding to the complexity are the relationships between characters. "You're never sure who to trust," said Pelling. "And you never know who might stab you in the back."

Combat will also be strategic, with players having to make use of cover and ability combos if they hope to survive. Players can also influence the battlefield by using environmental objects like cars or dumpsters.

The game is set in the fictional city of Iskendrun, which is on the brink of revolution. The player takes on the role of one of five characters, each with their own unique abilities and motivations. Their goal is to determine the fate of Iskendrun.

#  Who can play?

Since the early days of video gaming, parents have been wondering if video games are appropriate for their children. The answer to that question is not a simple one, and it depends on a variety of factors.

First and foremost, it’s important to know who can play video games. For the most part, video games are designed for people aged 12 and up. There are exceptions to this rule, of course; some games are meant for younger audiences, and there are also games that are rated Adults Only (AO) due to their graphic or violent content.

If you’re unsure about whether or not a game is appropriate for your child, it’s always best to check the rating before buying it. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) assigns ratings to video games based on their content, allowing parents to make informed decisions about what their children play.

There are a variety of factors that contribute to a game’s rating, including violence, sexual content, drug and alcohol use, and language. Some games may also feature flashing lights or intense sounds that could potentially cause seizures in some players.

It’s also important to keep in mind that not all children are the same. Just because a game is rated T for Teen doesn’t mean that it’s appropriate for all teenagers. Parents should always oversee their children’s gaming habits and be familiar with the content of the games they’re playing.

So who can play video games? Ultimately, it depends on the game and the player’s age and maturity level. As a general rule, video games are meant for people aged 12 and up, but there are exceptions depending on the content of the game. Parents should be familiar with both the ESRB rating system and the content of the games their children are playing in order to make informed decisions about what is appropriate for them.

#  What are the rules?

In any game of strategy there are a set of rules that must be followed in order to achieve victory. In the game of Go, these rules are simple and few in number. The most important rule is that stones cannot be placed on or captured from the board edge. Other important rules include: captures are made by surrounding an opponent's stone with your own, a player can only place a stone on an intersection where there is no stone of the same color, and stones forming a Black chain (or "group") are alive and cannot be captured so long as the chain has at least one live stone.

# How is the game played?

The game of Go is played between two players who alternate taking turns placing stones on the board. Black goes first, and then play alternates. On a player's turn they may either place one stone on the board or capture one opponent's stone. If a player captures an opponent's stone, they take all of the opponent's stones that are connected to it. Stones can only be captured if they are surrounded by opponent's stones. If a player cannot place a stone or make a capture, their turn ends and they must forfeit their turn. The aim of the game is to capture as many stones as possible while still protecting your own stones. The player who captures all of their opponent's stones, or has more capturing stones at the end of the game wins!

#  What are the objectives?



The objectives of this project are to:

- Train a deep neural network to classify C. difficile ribotypes with >98% accuracy
- Compare the performance of our deep learning model against a publicly available ribotype classification model
- Analyse the data pre-processing requirements for training a deep neural network for C. difficile ribotype classification
- Understand how a deep learning model can be used to improve the accuracy of ribotype classification

A deep neural network (DNN) is a type of machine learning algorithm that is able to learn representations of data that are more abstract than those that can be learned by a traditional computer algorithm. DNNs have been shown to be particularly effective at learning patterns in data, and have been used for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition and machine translation.

In this project, we will train a DNN to classify C. difficile ribotypes with >98% accuracy. We will then compare the performance of our DNN against a publicly available ribotype classification model. Finally, we will analyse the data pre-processing requirements for training a DNN for C. difficile ribotype classification.

#  What are the benefits?

There are many benefits of using a markdown editor. Some of the most notable benefits include:

- Increased efficiency: Markdown allows you to write in a very simple and efficient way. This makes it easy to create documents without having to worry about formatting.

- Improved readability: Markdown also helps to improve the readability of your documents by making them easier to read and understand.

- Increased flexibility: Markdown gives you more flexibility when working with documents, as it allows you to easily incorporate different elements into your documents.

Overall, markdown is a very powerful and useful tool that can help improve your productivity and writing skills.
