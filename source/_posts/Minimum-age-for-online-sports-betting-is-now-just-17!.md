#  Minimum age for online sports betting is now just 17!

Online gambling, in general, and sports betting specifically is now open to any person aged 17 years or older in the United Kingdom. This new legislation allows people from that age group to gamble online without having to break the law. Previously, the minimum legal age for online sports betting was 18 years old.

This change comes as part of the UK’s Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014, which also introduced new regulations for online casinos and other gambling platforms. The Act replaces the 2005 Gambling Act, which set the minimum legal age for all types of gambling at 18 years old.

The 2014 Act allows regions within the UK to set their own minimum gambling ages, provided that they are higher than 17 years old. Currently, there are no regions in the UK with a minimum age lower than 17 years old. However, it is possible that some regions may choose to lower their minimum age in the future.

# Ministry of Justice announces intention to increase minimum age for online casino play

In addition to increasing the minimum age for online sports betting, the Ministry of Justice has announced its intention to increase the minimum age for playing casino games online from 18 years old to 21 years old. This change would apply across all regions in the UK.

A consultation on this proposed change is currently underway, and interested parties are invited to provide feedback until September 12th, 2017. Comments can be submitted via email at casino@justice.gov.uk or by post at: Casino Consultation c/o Research and Statistics Directorate Ministry of Justice 102 Petty France London SW1H 9AJ

If implemented, this change would make the UK’s minimum age for playing casino games among the highest in Europe. The majority of European countries have a minimum age of 18 years old or lower. Only Denmark (25), Estonia (21), and Sweden (21) have a higher minimum age than 21 years old.

#  The minimum age for online sports betting is lowered to just 17 years old!

After years of lobbying by gambling firms, the minimum age for online sports betting will be lowered from 18 to 17 years old, the government has announced.

The change in the law comes into effect on 1 October and will see bookmakers including Paddy Power and William Hill able to take bets from youngsters.

Currently, people in Britain can only legally gamble at the age of 18, but ministers have decided to lower the threshold amid concerns that people are bypassing the law by using foreign websites.

Ministers say that the new measure will protect young people from being drawn into problem gambling, but critics argue that it is simply a move to help gambling firms make more money.

Under the new rules, operators will be required to ask for proof of identity from anyone trying to place a bet online and must block those under the age of 17 from accessing their websites.

Gambling firms have been pushing for the change in the law for some time, and say that it will allow them to tap into new markets and compete with casinos in other countries.

But anti-gambling campaigners argue that lowering the age limit will simply entice more young people into problem gambling.
