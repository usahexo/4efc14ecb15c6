#  Casino in Malaysia offers spin of the wheel for chance to win big!

Malaysian casinos are always trying to come up with new and innovative ways to keep players entertained and engaged. One way they are doing this is by offering a spin of the wheel for a chance to win big!

At the Resorts World Genting casino, players can take their chances at winning one of five progressive jackpots by spinning the giant wheel. The smallest prize is worth MYR 10,000 (about USD $2,500), while the largest is worth MYR 1 million (around USD $250,000).

To participate, players need to insert MYR 100 (about USD $25) into the machine. They then have a certain number of spins to try and win one of the top prizes. If they don’t hit the jackpot on their first spin, they can continue to play until they do.

This new promotion is designed to appeal to both casual and high-rolling players. And it seems to be working, as gambling in Malaysia continues to grow in popularity. In fact, it is estimated that Malaysians lost MYR 12.5 billion (USD $3.1 billion) to gambling in 2017 alone!
