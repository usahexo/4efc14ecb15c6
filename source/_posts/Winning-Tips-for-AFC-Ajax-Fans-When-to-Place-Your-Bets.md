#  Time to Place Your Bets: Soccer Insights on AFC Ajax

AFC Ajax, one of the most successful clubs in European soccer, kicked off their season in emphatic fashion on August 10th. In front of a sold-out home crowd, they defeated AZ Alkmaar 4-1 with goals from Dusan Tadic, Hakim Ziyech, David Neres and Lasse Schone.

This was a much-needed win for Ajax; they had lost their final preseason game 2-0 to Spanish powerhouse Barcelona. But make no mistake: the Blaugrana were without Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Gerard Pique on that evening.

Coach Erik ten Hag will be pleased with his team’s performance but knows there is still much room for improvement. The aim for the upcoming fixtures must be to solidify their defense and reduce the number of goals they concede - last season they let in 58 in 34 Eredivisie matches.

Ajax have never been shy about spending money on players and this offseason was no different. They recruited Quincy Promes from Sevilla for around €24 million and Ziyech from Chelsea (on loan) for a fee thought to be in the region of €11 million.

These new arrivals join an already star-studded squad which includes Brazil internationals David Neres and Richarlison as well as former Barcelona player Andres Iniesta. With so many quality players at their disposal, it will be interesting to see how Ten Hag deploys them over the course of the season.

The Amsterdam club have been busy in the transfer market this summer but have also lost some key players. Captain Matthijs de Ligt left for Juventus in a €75 million deal, while defender Nico Tagliafico moved to Atletico Madrid for around £26 million. These departures leave a big hole at the back which needs to be plugged if Ajax are to challenge for silverware this year.

In midfield, midfielder Frenkie de Jong has left for Barcelona in a deal worth up to €86 million. This move could be seen as a sign of weakness by other clubs but Ajax have reacted quickly and signed Bulgarian international midfielder Todor Dragoev from CSKA Sofia for a reported £13 million.

So far, things are looking bright for Ajax; they sit top of the Eredivisie table with six points from two games. They face Heracles Almelo away next before returning home to take on Belgian side Standard Liege in the Champions League playoff round. If they can navigate these tricky ties then they will be well placed to challenge for major trophies this season.
