#  How to get directly into the gambling den in Sleeping Dogs Creek Casino

Sleeping Dogs Creek Casino is one of the most popular gambling venues in the state. The casino has a range of games, from traditional table games and slots to more exotic options like baccarat and poker. However, if you're looking to get straight into the action, there is a way to bypass the main entrance and go directly to the gambling den.

The gambling den is located in the back of the casino, past the main gaming area. It's generally quieter than the rest of the casino, so it's a great place to get some peace and quiet while you gamble. The dealers are also less likely to rush you in the den, so you can take your time making your bets.

To get to the gambling den, simply go through the double doors at the back of the casino. You'll see a short hallway with a security guard standing at the end. Just ignore him and walk straight through to the gambling den.

Note that access to the gambling den is restricted to persons over 18 years old only. So make sure you have your ID with you if you plan on visiting.
