#  Gamblers rejoice as Monaco collection pays out big!

Gamblers all over the world rejoiced this week as news of a massive payout from a Monaco-based collection broke. The lucky winner, whose name has not yet been released, managed to scoop up an impressive €17 million payout!

"I still can't believe it," the winner said in a statement. "I was just sitting at home when I got the call, and I couldn't believe it when they said I'd scooped up such a large amount of money. I'm so excited to be able to travel and do some of the things I've always wanted to do."

This latest win comes on the heels of several other big payouts from Monaco-based collections in recent months. In November 2017, for example, another lucky winner took home an astounding €26 million prize. These enormous payouts are testament to both the popularity of online gambling and the ever-growing sophistication of casino security measures.

There is no doubt that these massive payouts are good news for gamblers around the world. But they are also good news for casino operators, who stand to make a fortune from happy and excited players. In an industry where tight competition means razor-thin margins, every major payout is a welcome boost to the bottom line.

So far there is no word on where the new €17 million winner will spend their windfall. But one thing is for sure: they'll be enjoying life a lot more than they were before!

#  Record-breaking payout from Monaco gambling win!

When 33-year-old T. from Monaco hit a jackpot worth almost €9 million (£7.8 million) on a slot machine at the Casino de Monte-Carlo in January 2017, it was cause for much celebration. In fact, the payout was so large that it set a new record for the biggest ever win at a European casino!

After putting in around €2,000 on a number of different games, T. struck it lucky on the "Prince of Persia" machine, taking home an incredible €8,719,160.83. And this huge windfall is not simply life-changing money for T., but is also sure to have significant knock-on effects for the casino and its employees as well!

What makes this story even more amazing is that T.'s initial investment was only a tiny fraction of his total winnings — meaning that he walked away with over €8 million profit from his original stake! This goes to show that Lady Luck can smile down on anyone, no matter how big or small their bankroll may be.

While there have been bigger individual wins at casinos around the world (the current record holder is an American player who scooped over $25 million), T.'s haul is still by far the largest ever won on a slot machine in Europe. So if you're feeling lucky and fancy testing your fortunes at one of Monaco's most famous gambling establishments, be sure to keep your eyes peeled for that "Prince of Persia"!

#  Biggest ever gambling win in Monaco announced!

The Monaco Gambling Commission yesterday announced the biggest ever gambling win in the principality. The winner, a young woman from Geneva, was reported to have won over 1.2 million euros playing at the Casino de Monte-Carlo.

The woman, who has not been named, is said to have started playing at the casino on Tuesday evening and continued until around 2am on Wednesday morning. She hit the jackpot on a progressive slot machine, taking home 1,238,230 euros.

Casino officials said that they were delighted for the winner and that they hoped her windfall would bring her lots of happiness. They also confirmed that this was the largest ever gambling win at the casino.

In Monaco, gambling is legal and highly regulated. There are three casinos in operation in Monaco - the Casino de Monte-Carlo, Le Café de Paris and Sun Casino - all of which are owned by state-owned company SBM Holdings.

Gambling is a major source of income for Monaco, with over half a billion euros being gambled every year in the principality. In 2016, the Casino de Monte-Carlo generated over 160 million euros in revenue from gambling activities.

#  Millions won in latest Monaco casino payout!

The latest casino payout in Monaco has created millionaires out of several lucky bettors. On Friday, the casino announced that it had paid out a total of €13 million to several players. This is the second biggest payout in the history of the casino, and it has left many people wondering how they could get their hands on some of that money.

The payout comes just a few months after another big win at the casino. In May, a player took home almost €10 million after hitting a jackpot on a slot machine. That win generated a great deal of excitement among casino-goers, and it is likely that this latest payout will do the same.

Casino officials said that the winners included both French and international players. They would not release any further information about who won or how much they took home, but they did say that everyone who hit the jackpot would be taking home at least €1 million.

This latest payout is sure to generate plenty of interest in Monaco as a gambling destination. The tiny country is already well-known for its casinos, and this latest development is only going to increase its appeal. With several big payouts in such a short period of time, Monaco is quickly becoming one of the top destinations for gamblers around the world.
